## Setting up the BAML Compiler and Runtime

#### Compiler Architecture Overview

<TBD — we will write more details here>

- `baml-cli/ VSCode` generates `baml_client`, containing all the interfaces people use to call the `baml-runtime`.

- **Pest grammar -> AST (build diagnostics for linter) -> Intermediate Representation (IR)**: The runtime parses BAML files, builds and calls LLM endpoints, parses data into JSONish, and coerces that JSONish into the schema.


### Steps to Build and Test Locally

1. Install Rust

2. Run `cargo build` in `engine/` and make sure everything builds on your machine.

3. Run some unit tests:
   - `cd engine/baml-lib/baml/` and run `cargo test` to execute grammar linting tests.

4. Run the integration tests.

## Running Integration Tests

The integration tests verify BAML's functionality across multiple programming languages. Each language has its own test suite in the `integ-tests/` directory.

### Prerequisites for All Tests

- [Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs/) (for building native clients)
- [BAML CLI](https://github.com/boundaryml/baml#installation)

#### Environment Variables
You can set up environment variables in two ways:

1. **Using .env file (Recommended for external contributors)**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the `integ-tests` directory
   - Required variables:
     ```bash
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
     # Add other provider keys as needed:
     # ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here
     # AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_key_here
     # etc.
     ```

2. **Using Infisical (BAML internal use only)**:
   - Install [Infisical CLI](https://infisical.com/docs/cli/overview)
   - Use the `infisical run` commands shown in examples below
   - External contributors should replace `infisical run --env=test --` with `dotenv -e ../.env --` in all commands

### TypeScript Integration Tests

1. Install prerequisites:
   - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Latest LTS recommended)
   - [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) package manager

2. Build the TypeScript runtime:
```bash
cd engine/language_client_typescript
pnpm build:debug
```

3. Set up and run tests:
```bash
cd integ-tests/typescript
pnpm install
pnpm generate
dotenv -e ../.env -- pnpm integ-tests  # or use infisical for internal BAML devs
```

### Python Integration Tests

1. Install prerequisites:
   - [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.8 or higher
   - [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) package manager

2. Set up the environment:
```bash
cd integ-tests/python
poetry install
```

3. Build and install the Python client:
```bash
# Note: env -u CONDA_PREFIX is needed if using Conda
env -u CONDA_PREFIX poetry run maturin develop --manifest-path ../../engine/language_client_python/Cargo.toml
```

4. Generate client code and run tests:
```bash
poetry run baml-cli generate --from ../baml_src
dotenv -e ../.env -- poetry run pytest  # or use infisical for internal BAML devs
```

### Ruby Integration Tests

1. Install prerequisites:
   - [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html) for Ruby version management:
     ```bash
     brew install mise  # on macOS
     # or
     curl https://mise.run | sh  # other platforms
     ```
   - Rust toolchain (installed above)

2. Set up mise and build the Ruby client:
```bash
cd integ-tests/ruby
mise install  # This will install Ruby version from .mise.toml
(cd ../../engine/language_client_ruby && mise exec -- rake compile)
```

3. Install dependencies and generate client:
```bash
mise exec -- bundle install
mise exec -- baml-cli generate --from ../baml_src
```

4. Run tests:
```bash
dotenv -e ../.env -- mise exec -- rake test  # or use infisical for internal BAML devs
```

### Adding New Tests

1. Define your BAML files in `integ-tests/baml_src/`:
   - Add clients in `clients.baml`
   - Add functions and tests in `test-files/providers/`
   - See [BAML Source README](integ-tests/baml_src/README.md) for details

2. Generate client code for each language:
```bash
# TypeScript
cd integ-tests/typescript && pnpm generate

# Python
cd integ-tests/python && poetry run baml-cli generate --from ../baml_src

# Ruby
cd integ-tests/ruby && mise exec -- baml-cli generate --from ../baml_src
```

3. Create language-specific test files:
   - Follow the patterns in existing test files
   - Use language-appropriate testing frameworks (Jest, pytest, Minitest)
   - Include both success and error cases
   - Test edge cases and timeouts

4. Run the tests in each language to ensure cross-language compatibility

### Debugging Tests

Each language has its own debugging setup in VS Code:

1. **TypeScript**:
   - Install Jest Runner extension
   - Use launch configuration from TypeScript README
   - Set `BAML_LOG=trace` for detailed logs

2. **Python**:
   - Install Python Test Explorer
   - Use launch configuration from Python README
   - Use `-s` flag to show print statements

3. **Ruby**:
   - Install Ruby Test Explorer
   - Use launch configuration from Ruby README
   - Use verbose mode for detailed output

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Environment Setup**:
   - For external contributors:
     - Create a `.env` file with required API keys
     - Use `dotenv` commands instead of Infisical
   - For BAML internal developers:
     - Ensure Infisical is configured correctly
     - Use `infisical run` commands

2. **Client Generation**:
   - Ensure BAML CLI is up to date: `baml update-client`
   - Check BAML source files for errors
   - Regenerate client code after changes

3. **Build Issues**:
   - Clean and rebuild language clients
   - Check language-specific toolchain versions
   - Verify all dependencies are installed

4. **Environment Variables**:
   - Set up Infisical correctly
   - Verify API keys are present
   - Check `.env` file if not using Infisical

5. **Test Timeouts**:
   - Adjust timeout settings in test configurations
   - Consider rate limiting for API calls
   - Use appropriate test annotations/decorators

### OpenAPI Server Testss

1. Navigate to the test directory:
   - `cd engine/baml-runtime/tests/`

2. Run tests with:

- `cargo test --features internal`

This will run the baml-serve server locally, and ping it. You may need to change the PORT variable for your new test to use a different port (we don’t have a good way of autoselecting a port).

> Instructions for testing a particular OpenAPI client are TBD.

## Grammar Testing

1. Test new syntax in the [pest playground](https://pest.rs/).

2. Update the following:

   - **Pest grammar**: Modify the `.pest` file.
   - **AST parsing**: Update the AST parsing of the new grammar.
   - **IR**: Modify the Intermediate Representation (IR).

3. Ensure all tests pass:

   - Run `cargo test` in `engine/baml-lib/`
   - Ensure integration tests still pass.

4. Modify the grammar for the [PromptFiddle.com](http://PromptFiddle.com) syntax rendering that uses Lezer, if necessary.


## VSCode Extension Testing

This requires a macos or linux machine, since we symlink some playground files between both [PromptFiddle.com](http://PromptFiddle.com) website app, and the VSCode extension itself.

**Note:** If you are just making changes to the VSCode extension UI, you may want to go to the section: [Testing PromptFiddle.com](#testing-prompfiddlecom).

1. Navigate to the TypeScript directory:
   - `cd typescript/`

2. Install dependencies:
   - `pnpm i`

3. Build and launch the extension:
   - `npx turbo build --force`
   - Open VSCode and go to the Run and Debug section (play button near the extensions button).
   - Select "Launch VSCode Extension" and press the play button.
     - This will open a new VSCode window in Debug mode.
     - You can open a simple BAML project in this window (refer to our quickstart guide to set up a simple project, or clone the `baml-examples` repository).

4. Reload the extension:
   - Use `Command + Shift + P` to reload the extension when you change any core logic.
   - Alternatively, close and reopen the playground if you rebuild the playground.


To rebuild the playground UI:

1. `cd typescript/vscode-ext/packages/web-panel`
2. `pnpm build`
3. Close and open the playground in your “Debug mode VSCode window”

## Testing [promptfiddle.com](http://promptfiddle.com)

This is useful if you want to iterate faster on the Extension UI, since it supports hot-reloading.

1. Navigate to the Fiddle Frontend directory:
   - `cd typescript/fiddle-frontend`

2. Start the dev server:
   - `pnpm dev`

3. Modify the files in `typescript/playground-common`

4. Use the `vscode-` prefixed tailwind classes to get proper colors.
